# DeerDiary
## Concept and Planning
### Idea
DeerDiary is an application which helps you Journal. Each day you visit the site, where you may write down a simple entry about your day. DeerDiary asks a random question each day, to help you engage and express your emotions. Not only that, it mentors you specifically to your journal entries, by reading the journal and asking specific questions to help you see what is not clear. The goal is to help you express.
#### Originality
DeerDiary seeks to improve QoL when journaling and most importantly support you with your expression, by asking questions specifically to your journal entries.  
### Technologies
#### Frontend
We will employ Blazor as our frontend, where it is independent from the backend and communicates through the API to the backend.
#### Backend
We will employ ASP.NET as our backend, where it connects to the DB and offers an API. Entity framework will be used as an ORM.
#### Database
We will employ SQLite as our Database.
